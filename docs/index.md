## It turns into Winamp

Load a classic `.wsz` skin from the
[Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org). The mini player includes a
spectrum analyser, equalizer, playlist, shade modes, and crisp integer pixel
scaling. [See the mini player in detail](/winamp/).

## MilkDrop with more than 10,000 presets

On first use, Snoop automatically downloads the original MilkDrop 2
presets and projectM's Cream of the Crop collection. They react to local
playback in a resizable window or fullscreen.
[See the controls and preset details](/milkdrop/).
